# Rudiments

This is repo which contains basic JavaScript exercises with jest tests.

## How to run

- Run `npm install`
- Pick an exercise (a file with .test.js)
- Remove `.skip` from the describe block
- Run `npm run test:watch` in the terminal
- If you are just starting with JS passing the first test already very good!
- When the basic test case is passing, remove `.skip` from the `BONUS` test cases for an extra challenge!

## How to check your work

- If the tests pass, your solution works
- Want to see a solution I implemented? use githistory
  - Install the [`Git File History`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomber.git-file-history) extension in VSCode
  - In a tab with `.test.js` file, open the command palette
    - MAC: command + shift + p
    - Windows & Linux: ctrl + shift + p
  - Enter `>Git File History` (this command should autocomplete)
  - You can now see solutions of the basic and bonus testcases
